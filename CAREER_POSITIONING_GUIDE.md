# Career Positioning Guide

This guide explains how to present your experience for junior-mid level developer roles.

## 🎯 The Key Message

You're a **hands-on full-stack developer** who was the sole technical resource at two healthcare startups. You built complete systems from scratch but are now looking to join a development team where you can focus on coding, learn from senior developers, and grow your technical skills.

## 📝 LinkedIn Profile Updates

### Headline (Update This!)
**Current:** Chief Technology Officer at Symmetry EAP

**Change to:**
```
Full-Stack Developer | React, TypeScript, Node.js, PostgreSQL | Building Web Applications
```

### About Section
```
Full-stack developer with 3 years building web applications from scratch. 

I've worked as the sole technical resource for three early-stage companies, where I:
• Built company websites from scratch using React, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS
• Developed custom management systems with scheduling, data storage, and authentication
• Set up AWS infrastructure and CI/CD pipelines
• Configured secure databases and compliance-ready data storage systems

While I held a "CTO" title at startups, my role was 90% hands-on development. I spent my days writing code, building features, and deploying systems - not managing teams or doing executive work.

I'm now looking to join a development team where I can:
✓ Focus purely on software development
✓ Learn from experienced engineers through code review and mentorship
✓ Contribute to a larger, more structured codebase
✓ Continue growing my technical skills

Associate degree in Information Technology from Purdue University with Software Development specialization (3.5 GPA).

Tech Stack: React, TypeScript, Node.js, PostgreSQL, AWS, Docker, Python, C#

Open to opportunities across all industries: tech, fintech, e-commerce, SaaS, and more.

## 🗣️ Interview Script

### "Tell me about yourself"
```
"I'm a full-stack developer with 3 years of professional experience building 
web applications from scratch. I've worked as the sole developer for three early-stage 
companies where I built their websites using React and TypeScript, and developed a 
custom management system with scheduling, authentication, and secure data storage.

Because I was the only technical person at these small startups, I wore a lot of hats - 
I handled the infrastructure setup, security, and even IT support. I held a 'CTO' title, 
but to be clear, I didn't manage any teams. It was 90% hands-on coding.

While it was an incredible learning experience building complete systems end-to-end, 
I'm now looking to join a real development team where I can focus purely on coding, 
learn from more experienced developers through code review and pair programming, and 
contribute to a larger, more structured codebase.

I have an associate degree in Information Technology with a Software Development 
specialization from Purdue (3.5 GPA), and I'm specifically interested in [company name] 
because [reason]."
```

### "Why are you looking to leave your CTO role?"
```
"Great question - I think the title can be a bit misleading. I was the sole technical 
person at a very early-stage startup, so 'CTO' really meant I was responsible for all 
the technical decisions. But in practice, I spent 90% of my time hands-on coding - 
building features, fixing bugs, deploying code.

What I loved was building the systems from scratch and seeing them come to life. What 
I'm missing is being part of a team. There's no senior developer to review my code, 
no one to pair program with, no one to learn best practices from. I want to be in an 
environment where I can grow my technical skills, contribute to a larger codebase, and 
learn from experienced engineers.

So I'm specifically looking for junior to mid-level developer roles where I can focus 
on what I love - writing code and solving technical problems - while learning from a 
team."
```

### "Aren't you overqualified for this role?"
```
"I can see why you might think that from the title, but let me clarify. At a startup 
with no other technical people, 'CTO' just meant I owned the technical decisions. But 
I was the entire development team - I was writing all the code myself.

What I haven't had is experience working on a team, contributing to an established 
codebase, following team coding standards, going through code reviews, or learning 
from senior developers. Those are exactly the experiences I'm looking for.

I'm not looking for a step down - I'm looking for the right step forward. I want to 
become a better developer, and the best way to do that is to work with other skilled 
developers on a team. That's why this role is perfect for where I am in my career."
```

## 📊 Key Points to Emphasize

### Always Mention:
1. ✅ "Solo developer" or "sole technical resource" (explains broad responsibilities)
2. ✅ Specific technologies: React, TypeScript, Node.js, PostgreSQL
3. ✅ "Built from scratch" (shows you can start projects)
4. ✅ Numbers: 1,000+ patients, 300+ clients, 500+ users
5. ✅ "Looking to join a team" (shows you're collaborative)
6. ✅ "Learn from senior developers" (shows humility and growth mindset)

### Never Say:
1. ❌ "I managed teams" (you didn't)
2. ❌ "I made strategic business decisions" (too executive)
3. ❌ "I prefer working alone" (red flag)
4. ❌ "I know everything" (arrogant)
5. ❌ Be vague about what you built

## 🎯 Cover Letter Template

```
Dear [Hiring Manager],

I'm writing to apply for the [Position Title] role at [Company]. As a full-stack 
developer with 3 years building web applications using React, TypeScript, Node.js, 
and PostgreSQL, I'm excited about the opportunity to bring my hands-on development 
experience to your team.

In my current role, I've been the sole developer for an early-stage startup where I:
• Built the company website from scratch with full responsive design
• Developed a custom management system with scheduling and secure data storage
• Implemented authentication, authorization, and compliance-ready security features
• Set up AWS infrastructure and CI/CD pipelines reducing deployment time by 75%

While I held a technical leadership title at these early-stage startups, my work 
was 90% hands-on development. I spent my days writing React components, designing 
database schemas, building APIs, and deploying to production - not managing teams.

What excites me about [Company] is [specific reason from job posting or research]. 
I'm specifically looking for a role where I can focus purely on development while 
learning from experienced engineers through code review and collaboration. 

I have an AAS in Information Technology with a Software Development specialization from 
Purdue University (3.5 GPA). I'd love to discuss how my experience building complete 
systems from scratch could contribute to your team.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,
Matthew Darabasz
